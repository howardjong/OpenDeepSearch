Objective:
Analyze price sensitivity for an all-day (9 AM–3 PM) camp in the greater Vancouver area targeting elementary children during spring and summer breaks. This innovative camp, blending arts, STEM, and sports, is led by a PhD scientist, an Olympic gold medalist, and a child psychology expert.

Scope and Focus:

Camp Comparison: Evaluate mixed-discipline camps versus general/specialty camps.

Pricing Analysis: Gather data for Van Westendorp and conjoint analyses to identify consumer price thresholds and value perceptions.

Competitive Landscape: Profile key local competitors and their pricing strategies.

Value-Added Services: Identify extra services (e.g., extended care, transportation, specialized learning outcomes) that parents value and are willing to pay a premium for.

Deliverable:
A concise, data-rich report detailing market trends, competitor insights, and actionable pricing strategies that highlight the camp’s unique value proposition—no sugar-coating, just straight-up insights with a dash of clever humor.
